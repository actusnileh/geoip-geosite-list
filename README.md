
# geoip-geosite-list

A Python script that generates a txt or json file to specify which domain is supported by a geosite. 

The data is sourced from the repository https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/ 

(GitHub does not display all the contents of the data folder in the repository, but here everything is conveniently in one file, making it easier to search through the file to quickly find the information).

I will also update the existing data in this repository if new domains are added.
(The .txt file contains only the supported domains, while the .json file provides details on which specific domains are hidden behind the name).
